# Booking Experience
A simple ASP.NET Core MVC Web App which I created to exercise what I've learned from the ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni.

## :information_source: How It Works

**Guests**
- Have access to home page for guests, all books page and book details page, also can see statistics. Can log in or register.

**Users**
- Have access to all books page,book details page, statistics of their reading experience, and my books page where they can see the books which they read and also can recommend books.


**When you run the project for the first time sample data will be seeded as well as these test accounts:**

- User 1 -> email: **user1@abv.bg** / password: **User.1**
- User 2 -> email: **user2@abv.bg** / password: **User.2**
- All Genres will be uploaded.
